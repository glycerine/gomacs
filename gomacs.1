.IR file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gomacs
is an emacs-like text editor. It accepts most of the standard emacs bindings,
and supports a good subset of GNU Emacs commands. The reasoning behind its
creation is a recognition of how emacsen generally do not conform to the
vim-philosophy of leaning on the shell with short editor sessions broken up by
lots of shell editing. In the design and implementation of
.B gomacs
much care has been taken towards making an editor that performs well in the
terminal while using emacs bindings, having usable defaults, and being as
intuitive as possible.
